# Tile
###A program to create tesselating tiles frpm images
The results can be surprisingly appealing with little artistic talent required of the user.
I will not be held resposible for any nightmares induced by using this program on images of faces.

The UI is quite simple, load an image and double click in it to place a sampling rectangle.
Drag the borders of the rectangle to resize and the center to relocate.

The resulting tesselated image is frequently more artistic/bizzarre/disturbing than you might have imagined....
